# Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Machine-Learning
This article explores [Sentiment Analysis using machine learning](https://wisetechcat.com/sentiment-analysis-using-machine-learning/), a crucial Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning application, and the popular Naive Bayes algorithm. An Ultimate Guide of [Data Science](https://wisetechcat.com/data-science) Project by [WiseTechCat](https://wisetechcat.com/).

1. Collect a dataset of text data with associated sentiment labels, such as positive or negative.
2. Preprocess the text data by removing any unnecessary characters, stop words, and performing tokenization and stemming as needed.
3. Split the preprocessed data into training and testing sets.
4. Implement the Naive Bayes algorithm for sentiment analysis using a suitable machine learning library, such as scikit-learn.
5. Train the Naive Bayes model on the training data.
6. Evaluate the accuracy and performance of the model on the testing data.
7. Use the model to perform sentiment analysis on new, unseen text data.
8. Document your project and results in a README.md file and push your code and any necessary data files to a GitHub repository.
9. Collaborate with others on the project through GitHub's pull request and issue tracking features as needed.
